I used to be a great fan of Vue, so in that moment I decided to build my personal web with Vue, the result was pretty satisfaying but now I look back and it's pretty simple but a little annoying, I learned a lot of things about Vue and how to work with some animations, so yeah, I enjoyed and learned building it.
