This is the actual iteration of my personal web, I built it with React JS using the Gatsby framework, which personally I started to love, It's kind of fun build web apps with it and I can learned a lot building with it, I tried to struture everything correctly and I think that I get a good result, so yeah I'm very proud of myself.
